# Particle Drawing
This is a quick experiment in making a bunch of particles flow into set areas, for the purpose of "drawing" with what should appear to be pseudo-natural/random motion.

[Demo](https://jandorfer.github.io/partidraw/)

The JS source makes use of [babel](http://babeljs.io/) for es6, so, to compile for general web use run `gulp` and it will put it all together in the /demo directory.
